    <h1>VAR vs LET: The difference is scoping.</h1>
    <p><strong>var</strong> is scoped to the nearest function block</p>
    <p>
      <strong>let</strong> is scoped to the nearest enclosing block (both are
      global if outside any block), which can be smaller than a function block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, variables declared with let are not accessible before they are
      declared in their enclosing block.
